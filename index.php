		Welcome to T3chSharkz29 LLC! 
		</p>
		<p>
		We are a company dedicated to color generation grids, our customers, and having a good time. We have developed an expansive and detailed color generation web-based program that is free to all users.

		<h2>
			About T3chSharkz29 LLC
		</h2>
		<p>
			T3chSharkz29 LLC was created by four college classmates in the spring of 2024. These four classmates had one dream in mind: pass CS-312. They spent a countable (but large) amount of hours planning, coding, testing, and goofing around to create this very website before you.
		</p>
		<h3>
		What T3chSharkz29 LLC means to us: 
		</h3>
		<p>
		<strong>T3ch</strong> is short for technology, except we replaced the ‘E’ with a ‘3.’ This is to set us apart from the competition by promoting us as a hip and modern company.
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Sharkz</strong> is the word ‘sharks’ where the ’s’ is replaced with a ‘z.’ This is to show customers we are extremely cool and up to date with modern slang.
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>29</strong> represents the 29 goals we had when we started this company. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is a list of all 29 reasons:
		</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>To generate colors inside a grid</li>
			<li>To get a good grade on this assignment</li>
			<li>To push oour programming limits</li>
			<li>Provide a free, and ad-free color generation system for our customers</li>
			<li>To show people how useful website development can be</li>
			<li>To eventually add advertisements to our site to profit off of our customers</li>
			<li>To eventually add a monthly subscription fee for customers who want no advertisements</li>
			<li>To make a lot of money</li>
			<li>To eventually sell the company, and use that to fund our next idea: a number generation grid</li>
			<li>To then sell our number generation grid for a larger profit that we will split four-ways</li>
			<li>To make enough off of our 1/4th of the profit to retire by age 29</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Reasons 12 through 26 have been redacted by the recommendation from our legal team
		</p>
		<ol start="27">
			<li>To use our money to start a streaming service called T3chSharkz29 Max +</li>
			<li>So we ourselves can generate color grids for use in other projects</li>
			<li>To make the world a better place</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		LLC stands for Limited Liability Company, which means our personal assets are not on the line in case of lawsuits, bankruptcy, or any other financial disasters.
