    <p>
        My name is Isaac Curtis. I am from Wyoming, but my family comes from around the world. My father comes from Washington and my mother comes from Wyoming. I am the Founder and President of Ramily Movie Night, which is CSUâ€™s premiere film club on campus. I spend my free time doing very little. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, cares, concerns, statements, compliments, insults, jokes, or anything else! You know where to find me.
